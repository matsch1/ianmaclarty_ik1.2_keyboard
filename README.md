My modifications to the ik1.2 keyboard of Ian Maclarty [Github Ian Maclarty](https://github.com/ianmaclarty/ik)

## PCB
The PCBs are modfied (not by me) to allow to use the same PCS for left and right side of the keyboard.

This requires some additional bridges on the bottom of the right hand side PCB.

## STL
To have a little more space below the PCBS for the bridges, and solder joints, I modified the bottom STLs.
- This increases the actual height of the keyboard by 1 mm.
- Increasing the gaps a little bit for easier mounting.

To have a little more space on top of the PCBS I modified the upper STLs.
- Increasing the gaps a little bit for easier mounting.

**There are only left hand STL files. They can be mirrored during slicing.**
This reduces effort during file maintenance.

## Keymaps
I changed the keymaps to fit my needs
